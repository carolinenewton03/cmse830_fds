Project Title

Resume Analyzer App

Why I Chose This Dataset / Idea

I wanted to build a practical app that helps users analyze their resumes, identify missing skills, and receive personalized course recommendations. It combines elements of text analytics, machine learning, and data visualization—aligning well with both data science and computer science goals.

What I’ve Done So Far (IDA/EDA)

Collected and cleaned resume text data (via uploads).

Parsed resumes using Spacy for NLP.

Extracted skills and matched them with job roles.

Performed IDA/EDA on skill frequency and role trends.

Preprocessing Steps

Tokenized and cleaned text with Spacy.

Extracted structured features (skills, roles).

Connected to MySQL for storing and retrieving user data.

Added Streamlit input and visualization features.

Progress So Far (Streamlit)

Built the core Streamlit app (MiniProject.py)

Enabled resume upload and skill extraction

Implemented skill-gap analysis and course recommendations

Admin panel for role and skill management

Next Steps

Improve UI and responsiveness

Integrate SQLite/remote DB for deployment

Add more advanced EDA charts
